# Predict First ðŸ”®

Test your intuitions about AI research papers **before** reading them!

## Why This Exists

Ever wondered if your intuitions about AI progress, risks, and capabilities align with the actual research? Now you can find out! Take a quiz on a paper's findings *before* you read it to see how good your predictions really are.

No peeking at the paper firstâ€”that defeats the whole purpose. How calibrated are your AI safety intuitions? Are you overly optimistic? Too doom-y? Find out now!

## Generate Quizzes with Claude

Want to add a quiz for a new paper? We've included a script to auto-generate quizzes using Claude:

```bash
# First, install dependencies
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API key in one of these ways:
# 1. Create a .env file (in project root, scripts dir, or current dir)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key

# 2. Or provide the API key directly via command line:
./generate_quiz.py --url "..." --quiz-id "..." --api-key "sk-ant-..."

# Generate a quiz from a paper URL
./generate_quiz.py --pdf-url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04675" --quiz-id "recursive-self-critique"
```

Once generated, you'll need to add the quiz to the registry in `src/data/quizRegistry.js`.

## Development

For the nerds who want to tinker:

```bash
# Get it running
npm install
npm run dev

# That's it! The rest is just standard React stuff.
```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

```
# Claude API key for paper quiz generation (optional)
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key

# Server port (default is 3000)
PORT=3000
```

If no API key is provided, users will need to enter their own keys for on-demand quiz generation.

Built with React, Tailwind, and Vite. No fancy backends or complicated setups.

Happy predicting! ðŸš€
