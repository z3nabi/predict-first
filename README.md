# Predict First ðŸ”®

Test your intuitions about AI research papers **before** reading them!

## Why This Exists

Ever wondered if your intuitions about AI progress, risks, and capabilities align with the actual research? Now you can find out! Take a quiz on a paper's findings *before* you read it to see how good your predictions really are.

No peeking at the paper firstâ€”that defeats the whole purpose. How calibrated are your AI safety intuitions? Are you overly optimistic? Too doom-y? Find out now!

## Features

- ðŸ§  Test your intuitions against real research findings
- ðŸ“Š Multiple quizzes covering different papers and topics
- ðŸ”„ Share quizzes with your AI-curious friends
- ðŸ“± Works on mobile (great for reading on the go!)

## Generate Quizzes with Claude

Want to add a quiz for a new paper? We've included a script to auto-generate quizzes using Claude:

```bash
# First, install dependencies
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up your API key in one of these ways:
# 1. Create a .env file (in project root, scripts dir, or current dir)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API key

# 2. Or provide the API key directly via command line:
./generate_quiz.py --url "..." --quiz-id "..." --api-key "sk-ant-..."

# Generate a quiz from a paper URL
./generate_quiz.py --pdf-url "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04675" --quiz-id "recursive-self-critique"
```

Once generated, you'll need to add the quiz to the registry in `src/data/quizRegistry.js`.

## Development

For the nerds who want to tinker:

```bash
# Get it running
npm install
npm run dev

# That's it! The rest is just standard React stuff.
```

Built with React, Tailwind, and Vite. No fancy backends or complicated setups.

Happy predicting! ðŸš€

## Adding Figures to Quizzes ðŸŽ¨

Quizzes can now include illustrative images, for example a key chart from the paper.  A quiz file supports **three** optional placements:

| Placement | Field on question object | Where it appears |
|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| With the question | `questionFigureId` | Shown immediately **above** the question text, before the user answers. |
| Inside context | `contextFigureId` | Shown inside the expandable "Show context" panel. |
| With the answer | `answerFigureId` (alias: legacy `figureId`) | Shown next to the explanation after the user submits their answer, and again in the summary view. |

### 1. Save your image

Put your PNG/JPG/SVG in `src/assets/figures/`.  Vite will hash the file at build time, so you **must import** the image in the quiz file instead of writing a string path.

```js
// example-quiz.js
import coolChart from '../../assets/figures/cool-chart.png';
```

### 2. Register the image in `figures`

Each quiz file exports a `figures` array parallel to `questions`:

```js
export const figures = [
  { id: 'coolChart', src: coolChart },
  // more figures ...
];
```

Only `id` and `src` are required; captions are intentionally omitted to keep the UI clean.

### 3. Reference the figure from a question

```js
export const questions = [
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'Which model performed best?',
    questionFigureId: 'coolChart',       // appears before question text
    // or contextFigureId / answerFigureId depending on placement
    options: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
    correctAnswer: 'C',
    explanation: 'Model C had the highest accuracyâ€¦',
  },
];
```

That's itâ€”refresh the dev server and the image will render in the designated spot.  Quizzes that omit these fields continue to work unchanged.
